# ðŸ§  COVID-19 Clinical Trials â€” EDA & Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores a real-world dataset of **COVID-19 clinical trials** collected from *ClinicalTrials.gov*.  
The goal is to:
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in global COVID-19 trials â€” such as study phases, status, and locations.  
2. Build a **basic Machine Learning (ML)** model to predict a studyâ€™s **status** (e.g., Completed, Recruiting, or Active) using structured trial features.

Itâ€™s designed as a **portfolio-quality internship project** demonstrating practical data cleaning, visualization, and beginner ML modeling skills.

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset
**Source:** [ClinicalTrials.gov COVID-19 Studies](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home)  
**File:** `data/covid_clinical_trials.csv`  
**Rows:** ~5,700  
**Columns:** ~25  

**Key Columns:**
- `Status` â€“ Current trial progress (Completed, Recruiting, etc.)  
- `Phases` â€“ Study phase (Phase 1â€“4)  
- `Conditions` â€“ Type of disease or condition studied  
- `Enrollment` â€“ Number of participants  
- `Study Type` â€“ Observational or Interventional  
- `Country` â€“ Extracted from `Locations`  
- `Gender`, `Age`, `Sponsor`, `Study Designs`, etc.


## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Steps performed:**
1. Loaded and inspected data (shape, types, nulls)
2. Cleaned columns and handled missing data
   - Dropped irrelevant fields (`NCT Number`, `URL`, `Study Documents`)
   - Filled missing categorical values with labels like `"Missing_<col>"`
   - Imputed numeric `Enrollment` using median  
3. Created new feature `Country` extracted from `Locations`
4. Simplified `Status` into 3 major categories (`Completed`, `Recruiting`, `Active/Other`)

**Visual insights:**
- The **United States**, **France**, and **UK** had the highest number of trials.  
- Most studies were in **Phase 2** or **Phase 3**.  
- Majority of studies were targeted at **adult participants**.  
- Enrollment sizes varied massively â€” highly skewed distribution.


## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model
A simple **Random Forest Classifier** was trained to predict the **Status** of a trial.

**Features used:**
- `Enrollment` (numeric)
- `Phases`
- `Study Type`
- `Country`
- `Gender`

## Results:
- Accuracy: ~70â€“75% (varies per random seed)
- Top predictive factors: Phases, Country, and Enrollment

This ML section shows the ability to preprocess mixed-type data, encode categorical features, and evaluate a baseline classifier.

## Key Insights
- Most trials were registered in high-income countries (U.S., Europe).
- Trial activity peaked during mid-2020 â€” early vaccine and drug research phase.
- Majority of trials were interventional and focused on adult populations.
- The model can moderately predict trial status using simple metadata â€” better text features could boost accuracy.
