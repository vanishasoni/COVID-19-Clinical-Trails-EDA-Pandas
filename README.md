# COVID-19 Clinical Trials — EDA + ML (Internship Project)

This compact project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a simple machine learning model to predict trial `Status` from a subset of features. It is designed for a beginner-friendly internship submission.

## Files
- `covid_eda_ml.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with EDA and ML pipeline
- `data/covid_clinical_trials.csv` — dataset (copied from uploaded file)
- `requirements.txt` — libraries needed

## How to run
1. (Optional) Create a virtualenv and install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open `covid_eda_ml.ipynb` in Jupyter and run cells.

## Notes
- This notebook is intentionally compact. For a stronger portfolio, add more feature engineering (text features from `Title`/`Interventions`), cross-validation, and model explainability (SHAP/LIME).
